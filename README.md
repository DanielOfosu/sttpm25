# Spatio-Temporal Transformer for PM2.5 Prediction

A transformer model for spatiotemporal time-series prediction for my Master's Thesis. Largely based on the [spacetimeformer](https://github.com/QData/spacetimeformer) model by Grigsby, Wang and Qi, 2021. (https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.12218) and [Informer](https://github.com/zhouhaoyi/Informer2020) by Zhou, Haoyi, et al. 2021 (https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.07436).

Currently ran from the jupyter notebook.
